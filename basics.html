            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such
                as <span>Node.js</span>, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can
                be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> Like many other programming languages, <span>JavaScript has variables</span>. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply
                    by naming the container.
                </li>
                <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a>n this tutorial, you will learn about JavaScript assignment operators to assign a value of its right operand to its left operand. An assignment operator assigns a value of the right operand to its left
                    operand.
                </li>
                <li><a href="#">Data Types</a>In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null. We refer to these as primitive data types. A single variable
                    can only store a single type of data.</li>
                <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a>The conditional statements in JavaScript are if, else, else if and switch-case statements. They are used for checking a specific condition and executing the code based on the specified condition.</li>
                <li><a href="#">Loops</a>Loops are control structures used to repeat a given section of code a certain number of times or until a particular condition is met. <span>Visual Basic</span> has three main types of loops: for.. next loops, do loops
                    and while loops
                </li>
                <li><a href="#">Loops</a>A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where
                    there is some obvious <span>relationship</span> between the input and the output.</li>
            </ul>
